# Heads Script

### About

This Universal Head Dots Script draws filled circles on the head of the opponent.
You can enable / disable the dots by pressing Q. You can also change this keybind inside the script.
You can also edit different settings about the dots, such as color, wheter they're filled or not, transparency and how big the dots are (size).

- This script remains undetected and has been tested on games with an *Anti-Cheat* system.
